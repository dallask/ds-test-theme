## Drupal crashes due to the absence of the `behavior` plugin

### Description
Drupal crashes with the:
`Drupal\Component\Plugin\Exception\PluginNotFoundException` exception.
It can happen right after the installation or after cache rebuild.
[<img src="/docs/known-issues/drupal-crashes-plugin-not-found.png" width="100%"/>](/docs/known-issues/drupal-crashes-plugin-not-found.png)

### Reason
- Drupal ignores the theme folder when it seeks for the modules.

### Solutions
1. Solution:
    - clear all tables in the db that have the `cache_` prefix
    ```
    TRUNCATE `cache_bootstrap`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_config`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_container`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_data`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_default`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_discovery`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_dynamic_page_cache`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_entity`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_menu`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_page`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_render`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_toolbar`;
    ```
2. Solution:
    - Place your modules into `otsk-drupal/docroot/modules/custom` folder
    - Run cache rebuild after that

## `MarginsBehavior` plugin returns int values instead of classes

### Description
This paragraphs behavior located in the module `otsuka_ds_paragraph_behaviors`.
It should return the final classes for margins and paddings based on the int values.
However, currently it returns only int values.

### Reason
- Some features use the same fields that are stored in one of the feature

### Solutions
- As a hotfix, in the abstract paragraph this issue solved by means of adding
prefixes to this int values.

### Proposals
The issue should be investigated and fixed. After that the abstract
paragraph should be fixed accordingly.

turns it to the empty destination.

Expected:
`<a href="#">Link</a>`

Actual:
`<a href="">Link</a>`

### Reason
- no data

### Solutions
- Add some suffix to the `#` symbol (`#[suffix]`, e.g. `#main`, `#top`)

### Proposals
The issue should be investigated and fixed.

## Media is not rendered on the front end in anonymous mode

### Description
It is because by default anonymous user has no permission to see All media.

### Reason

### Solutions
- Visit `/admin/people/permissions`, check `View media` for `ANONYMOUS USER`
and `AUTHENTICATED USER`, and save changes.

### Proposals
The issue should be investigated and fixed.
