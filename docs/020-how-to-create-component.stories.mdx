# How to create component with DS 2.0

## Component creation steps

Any of your new components MUST inherit (extend) one of abstract or one of the
children components that have already inherited (extended) one of the abstract
components in turn.

1. Determine what type of component you are going to create (block, layout, paragraph, menu, etc.)
1. Create a separate subfolder with the unique name in the appropriate folder inside  components/06-components folder
1. Create next files inside the component folder:
    - `[Component_name].stories.jsx`
    - `README.md`
    - `[component_name].yml`
    - `[component_name].twig`
    - `_[component_name]-[part-name].scss` (optional)
    - `[component_name].scss` (optional)
    - `[component_name].js` (optional)
1. Fill the `[Component_name].stories.jsx` with the certain component
structure/information/controls.
Use any existing component in the `components/06-components` as an example

1. If you create abstract component, fill all component controls from scratch.
If you inherit an existing component, just use controls from the parent and add/fix new if it needed

1. Fill the component documentation in the `README.md` file

1. Create the component library inside the `*.libraries.yml` file

1. Attach your component library inside the `[component_name].twig` file
by means of `{{ attach_library('[theme-name]/[component-library-name]') }}` or
by means of **on-demand loading** feature

1. Add SCSS and JS code if it needed (for JS using the Drupal behaviors
approach is mandatory. Behavior name should be unique)

1. Add twig debug in the template

1. Run (or restart) storybook with the “npm run storybook” command in the theme folder (Make sure that storybook runs without the issues)

1. Check that your component appears in the Storybook UI

1. Check all component controls to make sure that they really work as expected

1. Check the component `Docs` tab

1. Run build with the `npm run build` command in the theme folder
(Make sure that build runs without the issues)

1. Run build with the `npm run webpack` command in the theme folder
(Make sure that webpack runs without the issues)

1. Place your component in the appropriate Drupal template

1. Check that your component appears in Drupal and looks as expected

## Component extending
There are several abstract components in the folder `components/06-components`
for each part of the Drupal we use: layout, menu, block, paragraph.

Any other component should inherit (extend) one of the abstract components or
one of the children components that have already inherited (extended)
one of the abstract components in turn.
[<img src="/docs/components/components-extends.png" width="100%"/>](/docs/components/components-extends.png)

Children components should extend parental template with the `extends`
directive in twig template and should inherit parental Controls by means of
`import` directive and `argTypes` property of parental story.
As an example, you can use any of children components in the
`components/06-components/[component-type]` folders.
[<img src="/docs/components/components-parent-import.png" width="100%"/>](/docs/components/components-parent-import.png)

Children paragraph components also inherit parental behaviors.
And most of them should use **ONLY** parental behaviors.
However, if you need some extra behaviors inside your child component,
you can add it in the child template inside the block declaration.

Any components except abstract are children.

## Component Paragraphs twig template suggestions

There is a special paragraph behavior plugin (Custom twig template suggestions
`custom_twig_template_suggestions_paragraph`) that provided the possibility to
add the extra twig template suggestions to any paragraph that uses this behavior.

This feature works through `hook_theme_suggestions_alter()` and allows you to
create several different paragraphs by means of using single one (e.g. Wrapper)
without the necessity to create a separate paragraph type.

For example wrapper paragraph has a template suggestion:

`paragraph--otsk-ds-wrapper.html.twig`

If you add the word `carousel` to the wrapper paragraph behavior
`custom_twig_template_suggestions_paragraph` you will be able to create
a separate template with the name `paragraph--otsk-ds-wrapper--carousel.html.twig`
for this certain paragraph.

You can find several paragraphs that use such an approach in the current theme
`[theme_name]/templates/paragraphs` folder:
```
paragraph--otsk-ds-wrapper--card.html.twig
paragraph--otsk-ds-wrapper--complex1.html.twig
paragraph--otsk-ds-wrapper--complex2.html.twig
paragraph--otsk-ds-wrapper--cta.html.twig
```

## Component twig debug in Drupal

The default Drupal twig debug information will be available only in the Drupal
entity, but not in your nested components (atoms, molecules, etc.).
So, it would be totally difficult to see what exact atom or whatever
is used inside the paragraph or block.

There is a possibility to see what exact template is used inside the Drupal
entity. For example, you can see twig debug information inside any of
components in admin mode on Drupal.

To use this feature, just add the next string inside your component somewhere in block declaration:

`{% include "@components/global/_twig_debug.twig" with { component_debug_path: _self} %}`

It will add the next information about certain twig template path:

```
<!-- THEME STORYBOOK DEBUG -->
<!-- OUTPUT from '@components/paragraph/wrapper-accordion/accordion.twig' -->
```

This functionality is built on `hook_preprocess()` in `*.theme` file and
depends on the global twig debug option that is set in the twig config for Drupal
[<img src="/docs/components/components-twig-debug.png" width="320"/>](/docs/components/components-twig-debug.png)

This preprocess places the next: `\Drupal::service('twig')->isDebug()`
in the twig_debug_on global variable.

## Best practices

### **DO**
- Extend existing abstract or exact twig templates

- Define the default values for all twig variables inside the component

- Place component SCSS into a separated component-related SCSS file

- Use BEM approach for style encapsulation to avoid CSS overriding

- Use bootstrap default mixins and variables as often as you can

- Store all images for the components in `[theme_name]/images` folder

- Keep most of the Drupal default wrappers for the fields, blocks, paragraphs, etc.

- Each component in Storybook **MUST** have its own folder and its
own `*.story.js` file (the same for the component variants)

- Avoid placing complex logic inside the twig template

- Store the paragraph's extra settings in behaviors or twig variables

- After creating, deleting, refactoring, replacing, renaming components
run `npm run storybook`, `npm run build`, `npm run webpack`
to make sure that the integrity of the system is maintained

- After creating, deleting, refactoring, replacing, renaming components
fix the paths in `*.library.yml` file and in all dependent components

- Avoid using `import` directive in SCSS files
(it dramatically slows down the CSS building process)

- Wrap all fields inside your templates with the next construction:
```
{% block field_name %}
  {% if content.field_name %}
    {{ content.field_name }}
  {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```
to make your template extendible and field optional.

- Store all your components inside components/06-components folder in
accordance to Drupal entity types structure (block, paragraph, menu, layout)
to be ease of use

- Use twig namespaces inside your templates
(e.g.` @components/paragraph/abstract/paragraph.twig`)
(https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/components/understanding-twig-namespaces)

- Use JS webpack aliases for `import` directives instead of absolute or
relative paths (e.g. ‘import accordionItem from
`"@components/paragraph/wrapper-accordion/accordion-item.twig";`)
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-webpack-alias)

- Use Bootstrap components from storybook or from the original Bootstrap
site in most cases (same for tags, structures, classes, etc.)

### **DO NOT**
- Create block, paragraph, menu, layout, etc. from scratch without extending
- Decompose basic Drupal fields: link, image, file, etc.
- Use global CSS selectors, or selectors with common names
- Place components SCSS into one file or into global.scss
- Use custom mixins and variables as often as you can
- Store your images for the components wherever you want
- Remove all Drupal wrappers from fields, blocks, paragraphs, etc.
- Include several components or component variants inside the same folder
and the same *.story.js file
- Make import SCSS files inside the *.story.js files (all SCSS will be
imported automatically. All SCSS, except those have the prefix “_”,
will be built into the dist folder)
- Place a lot of logic inside the twig template
- Store most of the paragraph's extra settings inside the behaviors
- Store the paragraph's extra settings in fields
- Delete, replace, edit, refactor, rename any component or file you want
- Store your components wherever you want
- Create deep nesting (extends) for children components
- Use a custom html structure, classes, components without using Bootstrap
