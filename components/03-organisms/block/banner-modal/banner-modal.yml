We hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy during this unprecedented time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are currently taking JYNARQUE<sup>®</sup> (tolvaptan), we encourage you to stay in close contact with your healthcare professional team regarding regular appointments and treatment management plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this time, there is no expected impact on medication supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the current COVID-19 <span class=\"text-nowrap\">pandemic, the JYNARQUE<sup>®</sup> (tolvaptan)</span> REMS Program requirements remain in effect, as the health of patients who use this product is our top priority. Ongoing blood monitoring required by the REMS Program is extremely important due to the potential risk of serious liver injury from treatment with JYNARQUE. For these lab requirements during COVID-19 pandemic, we are able to temporarily offer our Mobile Phlebotomy Collection Service at no-cost for all patients taking JYNARQUE who prefer to have the REMS required blood work collected at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In helping patients who have lost a job or health insurance coverage due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to get through these challenging times, we have extended our Patient Support Program to provide ‘no-cost’ access for patients in the U.S. who are taking JYNARQUE. Please call Otsuka Patient Support at <a class=\"cta_phone\" href=\"tel:1-855-242-7787\">1-855-242-7787</a> for more information on both programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For help accessing JYNARQUE, go to <a class=\"cta_exit\" href=\"https://www.otsukapatientsupport.com/jynarque\" target=\"_blank\">www.otsukapatientsupport.com/jynarque</a> or call Otsuka Patient Support at <a class=\"cta_phone\" href=\"tel:1-855-242-7787\">1-855-242-7787</a>.
