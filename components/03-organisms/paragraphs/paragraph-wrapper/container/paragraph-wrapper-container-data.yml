    field_otsk_ds_text: "<p>A veil of snow blows across the slope…no different from any of the others.  It momentarily obscures Luke and his mount…and suddenly, without warning, a gigantic form explodes out of the snow almost under the feet of the lizard, which screams and rears, throwing Luke.  The monstrous shape…white on white against the snow-cloud, we do not see it clearly except that it is huge and menacing…utters a weird and bestial groaning like rocks boulders grinding together in the bowels of a mountain.  It strikes the lizard dead with one horrendous blow, breaking its neck.  Half stunned by the fall, Luke staggers up and attempts to draw the light-saber blaster holstered at his hip.  The snowman fetches him a blow across the face that would have taken part of his head off if it had not been for the helmet.  Luke falls.  Loses blaster.  He also has his light-saber..</p>"
