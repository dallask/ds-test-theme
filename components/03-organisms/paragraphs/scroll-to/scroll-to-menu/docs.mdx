# Scroll to menu documentation

The "Scroll to" functionality consists of two elements: "Scroll to menu" and "Scroll to Anchor"


## "Scroll to menu"

It is a menu that can be placed on top of a page after a title. You should add a **"Scroll to element navigation" paragraph** that consists of link ***titles*** and ***ids*** of the elements where a page should be scrolled to on clicking.

## "Scroll to anchor"

It is just a **div** container with one of the **ids** from the "Scroll to menu" element. It is invisible and should be placed right before the page element where a page has to be scrolled to.
